Now we will integrate home and shifts screens to the backend okay?

In order to do that, first things first, we need to fetch employment_id from:humanResourceApi.getActiveEmploymentId

then with that id we need to fetch team_id from: teamsApi.getActiveTeamId 

then with the team_id we need to fetch team details from: getTeam
then with the team_id we need to fetch team members from: getTeamMembers

then with the team_id we need to fetch shifts for that user's team from: 

and at last, we need to show team details and members on home screen along with employment details
and the shifts information on the shifts.tsx screen
